I attended the livestreams of [Kaggle CareerCon 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/careercon2019). [Rachael Tatman](https://twitter.com/rctatman) of Kaggle took sessions of wrapping machine learning models intp REST API endpoints and then deploying them on Heroku and GCP's AppEngine. 

I wanted to try the deployment part as I am aware of how to wrap a machine learning model as a REST API endpoint. Decided to start with something a bit complicated intentionally but the end result was very satisfactory to me. I used the Zomato reviews' data from [this repository](https://github.com/Nilabhra/kolkata_nlp_workshop_2019) and built a sentiment classifier out of it using TF 2.0. I then, built a `sklearn` pipeline including the `tf-keras` model (had to wrap it in a `sklearn` compatible model class) and a `CountVectorizer`.
